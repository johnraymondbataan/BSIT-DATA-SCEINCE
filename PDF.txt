According to video game publisher companies’ perspective, their goal is to make any game profitable for them.
Video game monetization is the process used by the game publisher to generate revenue. Big data analytics tools
is used for predictions on behavior and optimization of games in such a way that players will come back again 
and will be ready to pay money for playing. That will help the publisher company to make sure that the game is
profitable for them or not.

Game design:
Game design is the art of applying design and aesthetics to create a game. A designer needs to be creative to
design a powerful game. It is a complex process requiring various programming, visualization, and animation
skills. The designer has to play three different roles. Those are in the field of programming, creative writing
and graphic design.

Object identification:
Realistic graphics, application of artificial intelligence, and image recognition technologies are some main 
factors that a game developer or a designer should look upon. Game designer also has to understand the behavior
of the player.

Visual effects and graphics:
computer graphic techniques create a high impact on the visual effects in gaming. Motion capture in games, 
real-time rendering, and photo-grammatic are some mechanisms used for the development of visual effects and graphics 
design.

Personalized marketing:
Personalized marketing in gaming helps to increase the activity of the users and at the same time attract new
customers. Video game providers collect data from the market analysis that will help to appeal to the audience better.

Fraud detection:
Fraud was nearly always about making money in the fastest way possible for the fraudster, and it was generally
divided into two categories: - ‘True fraud’ and ‘Friendly fraud’. True fraud is fraud with the intent to steal money 
or to knowingly defraud a merchant. Friendly fraud is a fraud that usually happens without criminal intent. 
Therefore, gaming companies need to assure a high level of security for the player’s personal information and transactions
performed. Machine learning algorithms help to rescue gaming companies to detect fraud.

Social and customer analysis:
Social data and customer data analysis is essential to understand the customer’s perception of the games and
developing effective product strategies. It also helps the gaming industry to get customers’ insights into their
attitudes towards the brand and predict customers’ purchase decisions and brand loyalty. Big Data technology
helps the company to gather data from millions of players and analyze those to get insight.
