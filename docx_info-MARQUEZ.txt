Technology observations 

Several key technology observations can be made regarding the role of data science in game development.
Firstly, data science technologies, such as machine learning algorithms and data visualization tools, are
increasingly being used to analyze large amounts of player data and improve game design. This allows
game developers to create more personalized and engaging experiences for players. 

Secondly, cloud computing is becoming more popular in the gaming industry as a way to store and process
large amounts of data. Cloud computing allows game developers to analyze player data more efficiently,
and it can also reduce the cost of data storage and processing. 

Thirdly, data science can also be used to make data-driven business decisions. By analyzing player data,
game developers can identify trends and patterns in player behavior that can help inform marketing and
monetization strategies. 

Finally, there is a growing trend toward using data science to create more ethical and inclusive games.
For example, in the study by Zook et al. (2018), data science was used to create a puzzle game that was
more accessible for players with different skill levels. By using data science to improve accessibility
and inclusivity in game design, developers can create games that are more enjoyable for a wider
range of players. 


Technology Literature Reviews 

One of the key technologies used in these studies is machine learning. Machine learning algorithms can
be used to analyze large amounts of player data and identify patterns in player behavior. In the study
by Liao et al. (2019), machine learning algorithms were used to predict player engagement based on
in-game events. Similarly, in the study by Ribeiro et al. (2019), machine learning algorithms were
used to analyze gameplay data and identify level designs that were more engaging for players.

Another important technology used in data science applications in game development is data
visualization. Data visualization tools can be used to create visual representations of
complex data, making it easier for game developers to understand and interpret.
For example, in the study by Alshammar et al. (2019), data visualization tools
were used to analyze player feedback and identify areas for improvement
in a mobile game.

Cloud computing is also an important technology for data science in game development. Cloud
computing allows game developers to store and process large amounts of data without the
need for expensive hardware or infrastructure. In the study by Yu et al. (2021), cloud computing
was used to analyze player spending patterns in a free-to-play mobile game.

Finally, there is a growing trend toward using data science to create more ethical and inclusive
games. In the study by Zook et al. (2018), data science was used to create a puzzle game that
was more accessible for players with different skill levels. By using data science to improve
accessibility and inclusivity in game design, developers can create more enjoyable games for
a wider range of players. 

Data science technologies are increasingly used in game development to analyze player behavior,
improve game design, and make data-driven business decisions.
